# EcoMonitor
## Overview
This project aims to use machine learning, computer vision, and other modern technologies to assist in wildlife conservation efforts. The system will analyze wildlife data to monitor endangered species, track animal movements, detect poaching activities, and help in habitat preservation. It will also assist researchers by providing insights and data-driven solutions to help with decision-making and conservation strategies.

## Features
Species Identification: Detect and identify different wildlife species in images or videos using deep learning techniques.
Animal Tracking: Monitor and track the movements of animals using GPS data, camera traps, and satellite imagery.
Poaching Detection: Detect signs of poaching activities based on image analysis or abnormal patterns in animal behavior.
Habitat Monitoring: Analyze environmental data and monitor changes in habitats to help preserve critical ecosystems.
Real-time Alerts: Send alerts or notifications about any detected issues, such as poaching or endangered species in a specific area.
Data Visualization: Visualize wildlife data and trends over time to aid in conservation planning.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
Computer Vision: OpenCV, YOLO (for object detection and classification)
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation and analysis)
Geospatial Data: GeoPandas, Shapely (for geographic data analysis and visualization)
Web Technologies: Flask or Streamlit for real-time visualization and dashboard (optional)
Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (for storing species data and movement logs)
